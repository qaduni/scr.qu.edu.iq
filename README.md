# qa.qu.edu.iq — Quality Assurance & University Performance Department

Bilingual (Arabic + English) Hugo site for the Quality Assurance and
University Performance Department at Al-Qadisiyah University. Content is
edited through **Sveltia CMS** (Git-backed, commits straight to this
repo) and the static site is searched with **Pagefind**.

- **Hugo extended** (asset pipeline + SCSS support required) — content
  in `content/{ar,en}/`, config in `config/_default/`.
- **Pagefind ≥ 1.5** — client-side search index, built after Hugo
  against `public/`.
- **Sveltia CMS** — served at `/admin/`, configured by
  `static/admin/config.yml`. Backend is GitHub: editors sign in with
  their GitHub account and their saves become commits on `main`.
- **Theme `qu.theme`** — pulled in as a **git submodule** at
  `themes/qu.theme/` from
  [`qaduni/qu.theme`](https://github.com/qaduni/qu.theme). Hugo finds it
  via its default `themes/` lookup (the site uses `theme = "qu.theme"`
  in `config/_default/hugo.toml`).

For HTML / CSS / JS / partials / shortcodes, see
[`themes/qu.theme/README.md`](themes/qu.theme/README.md). This README is
for **site authors and operators** — running the site, adding content,
deploying.

## Prerequisites

- Hugo, **extended** edition. Verify with `hugo version` — the output
  must contain the word `extended`.
- Node.js + npm (only used to run Pagefind).

```bash
brew install hugo            # macOS
pacman -S hugo               # Arch
sudo apt install hugo        # Debian/Ubuntu (must be the extended package)
```

## Local development

The theme is a git submodule, so clone with `--recurse-submodules` (or
run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in an existing clone)
before doing anything else — otherwise `themes/qu.theme/` will be empty
and `hugo` will fail to find layouts.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/qaduni/qa.qu.edu.iq
cd qa.qu.edu.iq
npm install                  # one-time — pulls Pagefind
hugo server                  # live-reload dev server at http://localhost:1313
```

To pull theme updates later:

```bash
git submodule update --remote themes/qu.theme
```

For a production-shaped preview **with search**:

```bash
hugo --gc --minify
npx pagefind --site public
npx serve public             # or any static server
```

`npm run dev` runs `hugo server`; `npm run build` runs
`hugo --gc --minify && pagefind --site public`. Either is fine — the
explicit commands above are equivalent.

## Project layout

| Path | What lives there |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| `content/{ar,en}/` | Markdown content, per language |
| `themes/qu.theme/` | Submodule — layouts, CSS, JS, fonts, theme images |
| `assets/images/` | Site images served via Hugo Pipes (logo, hero) |
| `static/` | Files served as-is at the URL root (`admin/`, `robots.txt`, `sw.js`, `images/news/`, `images/announcements/`) |
| `data/` | Site data (`colleges.yaml`, `statistics.yml`) |
| `i18n/` | UI strings (`ar.yaml`, `en.yaml`) |
| `config/_default/` | Site config — `hugo.toml`, `params.toml`, `menus.{ar,en}.toml`, `minify.toml` (annotated inline) |
| `config/production/` | Production-only overrides (merged on top of `_default`) |
| `pagefind.yml` | Search index config |

## Authoring content

### Add a news article

Create the file in each language you have content for:

```
content/ar/media/news/2026-graduation-ceremony.md
content/en/media/news/2026-graduation-ceremony.md
```

Frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Graduation ceremony 2026"
date: 2026-05-20
description: "Short summary shown in the list and as the OG description."
type: news              # one of: news, academic, administrative, students, general
important: false        # set true to flag as "Important" in the list view
image: /images/news/grad-2026.webp   # optional cover; put the file in static/images/news/
---

Body content as Markdown.
```

Announcements work identically under `content/{ar,en}/media/announcements/`.

### Add a regular page

Drop a `.md` under `content/{ar,en}/<section>/<page>.md`. The parent
section uses `section.html` (a card grid of children) and the page uses
`single.html`.

### Translate or add a UI string

Strings displayed by the templates live in `i18n/ar.yaml` and
`i18n/en.yaml`:

```yaml
# i18n/en.yaml
welcome_message: "Welcome to Al-Qadisiyah University"
```

```yaml
# i18n/ar.yaml
welcome_message: "أهلا وسهلا بكم في جامعة القادسية"
```

Templates use them as `{{ i18n "welcome_message" }}`. Always add the key
to **both** files — a missing key renders as the key name in the output.

## Content editor (CMS)

Sveltia CMS is served at `/admin/`. Config: `static/admin/config.yml`.

- Backend: **GitHub** — commits go straight to `qaduni/qa.qu.edu.iq`
  on `main`. Editors sign in with their GitHub account; access is
  managed via repo permissions.
- Media uploads land in an S3-compatible bucket (Garage). Credentials
  are injected at deploy time — **never** commit them to
  `static/admin/`, the file is served publicly at `/admin/config.yml`.

> **TODO(CR-03)** — the production CMS's media-upload path is currently
> non-functional: `static/admin/config.yml` declares an endpoint /
> bucket / region for Garage but no deploy-time auth proxy exists to
> mint a short-TTL access-key / secret-access-key pair into the browser,
> so the SigV4 signer has no credentials. Options on the table:
> build-time substitution of secrets (rejected — `config.yml` is
> public), a Cloudflare Worker that returns short-TTL session creds, or
> presigned PUT URLs minted by GitHub Actions. Until one of these is
> wired up, editors can author text content but cannot upload images
> through the production CMS. The local-dev variant at `/admin/local/`
> works fine because `garage/bootstrap.sh` seeds the secret into
> `localStorage`. See REVIEW.md / CR-03 for the full discussion.

## Search (Pagefind)

News and announcements are indexed into **two separate Pagefind bundles** so
each list page has its own search box: the News page searches only news, the
Announcements page searches only announcements. Indexing runs **after** Hugo,
once per section (see `npm run index`, `package.json` and the `Dockerfile`):

```bash
hugo --gc --minify
npx pagefind --site public --glob "**/media/news/**/*.html"          --output-subdir pagefind-news
npx pagefind --site public --glob "**/media/announcements/**/*.html" --output-subdir pagefind-announcements
# (or just: npm run build)
```

The on-page UI is the stock **Pagefind Default UI** (`pagefind-ui.js` +
`pagefind-ui.css`, no custom site CSS), instantiated per section in the
site-level override `layouts/_default/list.html` with the matching
`bundlePath`. RTL and translations are handled automatically from
`<html lang>` and `<html dir>`.

Shared indexing settings (excluded chrome selectors) live in `pagefind.yml`;
each run supplies its own `--glob`/`--output-subdir`. A section with no
articles yet (e.g. announcements before the first post) produces no bundle —
`pagefind` exits non-zero on an empty index, so that one run is tolerated in
the build, and the list page only renders its search box once it has articles.

If you add fields that should be filterable or searchable, see the
"Pagefind conventions" section in the theme README.

## Configuration knobs

Config lives in `config/_default/` (split across `hugo.toml`,
`params.toml`, `menus.{ar,en}.toml`, `minify.toml`) with production
overrides in `config/production/`. Files are heavily annotated inline.
The settings most often touched:

- `baseURL` — change before deploying behind a new domain.
- `[params.contact]` — email, phone, address shown in the footer and
  used by JSON-LD `contactPoint`.
- `[params.social]` — social media URLs (footer + JSON-LD `sameAs`).
- `[params.externalServices]` — Moodle, SIS, library, etc. (top bar +
  services section).
- `campusMapEmbed` — Google Maps embed URL used by the
  `{{< google-map >}}` shortcode on contact pages.

Logo and hero image URLs are **not** params — they're resolved through
the theme's `site-assets.html` partial. See the theme README.

## Deployment

The site is a plain static build of `public/`:

```bash
hugo --gc --minify
npx pagefind --site public
# Belt-and-braces: hugo.toml already excludes static/admin/local/ from
# production builds (see CR-01 in REVIEW.md), but this rm catches the
# case where someone runs `hugo --environment development` then deploys
# the output. Cheap and safe — the directory is local-dev tooling only.
rm -rf public/admin/local
# upload public/ to your static host
```

When configuring the host:

- Serve `manifest.webmanifest` with `Content-Type: application/manifest+json`.
- Long cache headers (`max-age=31536000, immutable`) for `/fonts/`,
  `/css/bundle.*.css`, `/js/main.*.js` — they're content-hashed by Hugo.
- Short or no cache for top-level HTML.
- Production-deploy check: verify `public/admin/local/` is empty or
  absent before uploading. It should contain a Garage Secret Access Key
  if `bootstrap.sh` was run locally; never publish it.
